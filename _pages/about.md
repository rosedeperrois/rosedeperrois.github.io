About
--------
Welcome! I am a PhD candidate working at INRAE and Université Grenoble Alpes, under the supervision of Adélaïde Fadhuile and Julie Subervie. 

My research interests are at the intersection of environmental and agricultural economics. I work on establishing the role of social factors in shaping farmers' decisions to adopt agroecological practices, with a focus on peer effects and information diffusion. To do so, I use both quasi-experimental and experimental approaches. 

From February to May 2026, I'll be visiting Columbia University's Center for Environmental Economics and Policy, hosted by Prof. Jeffrey Shrader.
