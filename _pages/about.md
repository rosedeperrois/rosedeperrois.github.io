Welcome! I am a PhD candidate working at INRAE and Université Grenoble Alpes, under the supervision of Adélaïde Fadhuile and Julie Subervie. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental and agricultural economics. I work on establishing the role of social factors in shaping farmers' decisions to adopt agroecological practices, with a focus on peer effects and information diffusion. To do so, I use both quasi-experimental and experimental approaches. 

From February to May 2026, I'll be visiting Columbia University's Center for Environmental Economics and Policy, hosted by Prof. Jeffrey Shrader.

<summary class="btn btn-abstract">Abstract</summary>    <p>Social learning is likely to play a crucial role in disseminating new agricultural technologies and driving the agroecological transition in European countries. We evaluated a French pesticide reduction programme designed to train farmers and promote practices through demonstration days on participating farms. Using pseudo-panel data from surveys conducted before and after the program’s launch, we found evidence of decreased pesticide use among cohorts linked to farms attending demonstration days. Our analysis, supported by a placebo test and various robustness checks, suggests that peer-sharing in training programs can scale up effectively at no additional cost.</p>

<summary class="btn btn-abstract">Abstract</summary>    <p>Peer-to-peer knowledge diffusion is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism in various economic contexts and may play a crucial role in fostering the adoption of agroecological practices among farmers. However, the conditions for effective peer learning remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the role of the injection point – the first individual to receive information – within a peer group. This study examines whether the profile of the injection point affects the diffusion of agroecological knowledge. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with roughly 850 voluntary French farmers, randomly assigned to peer groups on a digital communication platform. Over an 18-month period, only one farmer per treated group receives information on agroecology, serving as the injection point for diffusion. Treatment varies according to whether the injection point is an early adopter of agroecology or an ordinary peer. A benchmark group receives direct broadcasting of the information to all members. The experiment began in January 2025 and will run until June 2026, with data collection ongoing.</p>
