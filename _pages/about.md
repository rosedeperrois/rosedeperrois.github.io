About
--------
Welcome! I am a PhD candidate working at INRAE and Université Grenoble Alpes, under the supervision of Adélaïde Fadhuile and Julie Subervie. 

My research interests are at the intersection of environmental and agricultural economics. I work on establishing the role of social factors in shaping farmers' decisions to adopt agroecological practices, with a focus on peer effects and information diffusion. To do so, I use both quasi-experimental and experimental approaches. 

From February to May 2026, I'll be visiting Columbia University's Center for Environmental Economics and Policy, hosted by Prof. Jeffrey Shrader.

    <p>Social learning is likely to play a crucial role in disseminating new agricultural technologies and driving the agroecological transition in European countries. We evaluated a French pesticide reduction programme designed to train farmers and promote practices through demonstration days on participating farms. Using pseudo-panel data from surveys conducted before and after the program’s launch, we found evidence of decreased pesticide use among cohorts linked to farms attending demonstration days. Our analysis, supported by a placebo test and various robustness checks, suggests that peer-sharing in training programs can scale up effectively at no additional cost.</p>
